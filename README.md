ðŸ”­ a<strike>n aspiring</strike> data analytics engineer interested who's worked in data analyst, engineering, and data ops roles, most recently becoming a data ops and pipeline development lead. I also love to learn and code anything (and share by teaching) having built applications in Python, Java, and C# (+ a lot of SQL) every so often for fun and an occassional group project. Additionally, I have been published as a writer and editor of creative works at the collegiate level :newspaper: :books:. 

Currently learning about cloud platforms as they have left us on-premise folks behind. Would love to ðŸ‘¯ on developing learning opportunities for folks in the data engineering, integration, and automation space, and anything interesting where beginners are invited! If you'd like to connect and exchange ideas in life and data, you can ðŸ“« me [here! :blush:](mailto:siawayforward.projects@gmail.com). If you are hiring and would like to reach out, [this one](mailto:scmbatia@gmail.com) is for you!

:smirk: Lastly, No WNBA slander accepted here, and I'll volunteer information about it, unprompted :smile: :heart_eyes:. 
(Go Lynx! :blue_heart: :green_heart:)
