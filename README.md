An aspiring data science analyst interested in bridging the cultural gap by assimilating more languages and dialects into the natural language processing pipeline. I also love to learn and code anything, having built applications in Python, Java, and C# every so often for fun and an occassional group project. Additionally, I have been published as a writer and editor of creative works :newspaper: :books:. 

Currently ðŸ”­ **data science job hunting (so HOLLA!)** while learning and refreshing my knowledge on how to apply statistics, calculus, and linear algebra to AI/ML. Would love to ðŸ‘¯ on developing modules/packages in Python, Java, and anything interesting where beginners are invited! If you'd like to connect and exchange ideas in life and data science, you can ðŸ“« me [here! :blush:](mailto:siawayforward.projects@gmail.com)

:smirk: Lastly, No WNBA slander accepted here, and I'll volunteer information about it, unprompted :smile: :heart_eyes:. 
(Go Lynx! :blue_heart: :green_heart:)
