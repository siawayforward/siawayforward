### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Sia, an up and coming data science analyst interested in bridging the cultural gap by assimilating more languages and dialects into the natural language processing pipeline. I also love to code anything, having built applications in Python, Java, and C# every so often for fun and an occassional group project.
