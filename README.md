🔭 **data and developer job hunting** and an aspiring data analytics engineer interested in bridging the cultural gap by assimilating more languages and dialects into the natural language processing pipeline and automation. I also love to learn and code anything, having built applications in Python, Java, and C# (+ a lot of SQL) every so often for fun and an occassional group project. Additionally, I have been published as a writer and editor of creative works at the collegiate level :newspaper: :books:. 

Currently learning about cloud platforms as they have left us on-premise folks behind. Would love to 👯 on developing modules/packages in Python, Java, and anything interesting where beginners are invited! If you'd like to connect and exchange ideas in life and data science, you can 📫 me [here! :blush:](mailto:siawayforward.projects@gmail.com). If you are hiring and would like to reach out, [this one](mailto:scmbatia@gmail.com) is for you!

:smirk: Lastly, No WNBA slander accepted here, and I'll volunteer information about it, unprompted :smile: :heart_eyes:. 
(Go Lynx! :blue_heart: :green_heart:)
