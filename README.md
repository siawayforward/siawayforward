### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Sia, an up and coming data science analyst interested in bridging the cultural gap by assimilating more languages and dialects into the natural language processing pipeline. I also love to learn and code anything, having built applications in Python, Java, and C# every so often for fun and an occassional group project.

- ðŸ‘¯ Looking to collaborate on developing modules/packages in Python, Java, and anything interesting where beginners are invited!
- ðŸ¤” Looking to improve on networking in data science and exchanging tips on methods and ideas for packages
